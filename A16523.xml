         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <note place="margin">The Gentiles by the light of nature kept ſome daies holy.</note> for though it was ſo, that they knew not the inſtitution of the ſeuenth day, much leſſe did they keepe it, yet ſome daies by a common conſent they ſeuered from their worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, and dedicated them to the ſeruice of their Gods: nay though they did altogether ſo hate the onely true holy day, that neither would they obſerue it themſelues, and alſo <hi>mocked the Iewes for obſeruing it;</hi>

And therefore though they could not attaine to the knowledge of the day, much leſſe the true maner of ſanctifying it without the word: yet that there ſhould be a day differing from other in vſe, ſequeſtred from the common affaires of the world, and conſecrated to the worſhip of God, this was that which did ſhew it ſelfe to them whether they would or no.</p>

For lamentable experience in themſelues doth teach them, that though they obſerue the Sabbath neuer ſo diligently, according to Gods good comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement: yet by reaſon of ſinnes (which is ſo bred in the bones, that it will not out in the fleſh) they finde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues failing in many dueties to God and men, very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ward many times to thoſe that they doe, and ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting them; falling into many ſinnes, prone vnto a great many moe, and ſo hardly with great ſtriuing to keepe an eeuen courſe of life, that in their conſciences they doe aſſuredly ſubſcribe vnto this truth, that if there were no Sabbath at all, they were moſt miſerable, and ſhould become like vnto the reſt of the world.

Beſides there bee other, who iuſtly condemning the Papiſts for this intruſion of dayes, yet are perſuaded not onely that the day which wee nowe keepe, may bee changed by the Church without any offence, but that the number of ſeuen may bee altered, contrary to that which hath continued from the beginning. Therefore, we muſt needes acknowledge it to be the ſingular wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and mercy of God towardes his Church thus by ſanctifiyng the <hi>ſeuenth day</hi> to ende the ſtrife: For as we ſee in Gods ſeruice, when men goe away from his word, there is no end of deuiſing that which hee alloweth not, and they fall vpon euery thing, ſauing vpon that they ſhould: ſo in appointing the day if wee be not ruled by the worde, wee ſhall find by experience that euery day will ſeeme more conuenient to vs then that, at leaſtwiſe we ſhall ſeeme to haue as good reaſon to keepe any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as <hi>the ſeuenth.</hi>

For as no man in the worlde can of himſelfe make this promiſe vnto men, that they ſhall bee waſhed and clenſed from their ſinnes by the bloud of Chriſt, and that by his body and bloud they ſhall be nouriſhed in ſoule and in body vnto euerlaſting life: ſo none in the worlde can appoint out the meanes whereby God will conuey theſe ineſtimable treaſures vnto vs, put vs into the poſſeſſion of them and make vs aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of them, which when himſelfe hath done wee cheerefully looke for that good from them, becauſe hee is <hi>faithfull and true,</hi> that hath ſayd, hee hath thus <hi>bleſſed</hi> them for vs. In regard of which, as the Iewes did faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully keepe that <hi>ſeueth day</hi> to the end, which they knew by the word, which onely God bleſſed and ſanctified for their vſe, ſo it was vnlawfull for them to change it for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, becauſe they had not that warrant that they ſhould be ſpecially bleſſed vnto them, as they had for this, which being that very day, vpon which <hi>the Lorde himſelfe rested from all his worke which hee made,</hi> hee did therefore <hi>bleſſe this ſeuenth day and ſanctified it,</hi>

And when all the Gentiles round about ſayd, that they worſhipped euery one of them the true God, (and yet they did not thus knowe him by his word, and by his works, and therefore made him but am Idoll) they by their practiſe in obſeruing that <hi>ſeuenth day</hi> did ſhewe, that they did know him aright, and ſo made him knowne vnto others: the glorie of which worke had beene obſcured and darkened, if they had changed <hi>the number of that day,</hi> which the Lord in wiſedome left to his Church to bee obſerucd in the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and diſcipline of it, when hee might haue appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome other, that ſo the benefit of our creation might alwaies with praiſe be remembred in the Church, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as it is ſaid in the words of the commaundement. <hi>In ſixe daies, the Lord made the heauen and the earth,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Wherein, that we might be the rather eſtabliſhed, we muſt remember, that not only, that name of the day was changed together with it, but it was changed into that very name it hath now, vpon theſe ſpeciall reaſons, that we haue alreadie heard.<note place="margin">The name of the Sabbath was changed into the name of the Lords day, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</note> For it is called the <hi>Lords day,</hi> euen of the <hi>Lord Ieſus,</hi> and it hath the honorable name of him, who vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that day did <hi>ariſe</hi> in greateſt honor, in ſo much that we ought not onely to keepe the day, but to keepe it in his <hi>right name,</hi> eſpecially, ſeeing part of the honour of it is <hi>in the name.</hi> For as we doe breed reuerence of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in mens hearts, by ſpeaking of it after his owne proper name, <hi>the Lords Supper, the cuppe of the Lord, the Lords table:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20.27. <hi>and</hi> 10.21.</note> ſo it maketh the day more highly to bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed (as it ought) when we call it by his right name re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly, <hi>the Lords day,</hi> and doe not miſcall it by a wrong name, as the heathen haue done prophanely, <hi>the Sunday:</hi> who hauing aſcribed the gouernment of the ſeuen daies in the weeke vnto the ſeuen Planets, and hauing accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly giuen them their names, as appeareth more eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently in the Latin,<note place="margin">Dies ſolis, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae, Martis, &amp;c</note> then in our Engliſh names: yet ſo it is that any of the daies might be called <hi>Sunday,</hi> as well as that which is, without any offence. But it is not ſo <hi>in the name of the Lords day:</hi> for as by it can bee ment no other day, but that which wee keepe for our Sabbath, ſo the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:13563:30"/> name cannot be imparted to any other day without ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge. Therefore as the Iewes did carefully retaine the name of <hi>the Sabath,</hi> according to the firſt inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo ought we to acquaint our ſelues with the name <hi>of the Lords day.</hi> Thus did the Chriſtians vſe to call it in former times, as it is well obſerued by that ancient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Beda, Mos Chriſtianus appellat,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Beda in Luk. <hi>24.1.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>It is the manner of the Chriſtians to call it the Lords day, becauſe of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of our Lord:</hi> where he ſayth, that not onely now and then they did ſo ſpeake, but that it was an vſuall maner among them. And we had need to doe it ſo much the more, becauſe it behooueth vs to vſe al good meanes, to aduance the <hi>credite of this day</hi> in mens conſciences, in theſe prophane and irreligious times, eſpecially wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as the contempt of all religion appeareth in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo eſpecially it bewrayeth it ſelfe in this, that the <hi>Lords day</hi> is euery where ſo vnhallowed. Nowe, if the wiſedome of the world hath taught the heathen to be ſo circumſpect in their generations, as by the falſe names of dayes to keepe the memorie and honour of their falſe gods, ſhould not the wiſedome of Gods ſpirite teach vs to bee as carefull in our generations to take into our mouthes <hi>that holy name of the Lords day,</hi> which as it is commended vnto vs in the word, not deuiſed by man, as the other, ſo it doth greatly adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the <hi>dignity</hi> of the day, as that which is deriued from the name of the moſt high?</p>
            <p>And if a mortall man doth take himſelfe to bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced,<note place="margin">Therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth part of the honor of this day.</note> not onely when hee is called by a wrong name, but alſo when hee hath not his right name and iuſt titles giuen vnto him: ſo no doubt, the honour of the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth not to be ſo great as it is, when it wanteth that <hi>moſt excellent name,</hi> by the which it is commended vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs in the ſcriptures. I grant indeed it will ſeeme ſtrange vnto vs at the firſt to change the name, (as all new things for a while bee ſtrange) but wee knowe that euery thing muſt haue a beginning, and that which is at the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:13563:31"/> in a fewe particulars, is afterwards in time receiued of multitude, &amp; ſo by cuſtome groweth into a law, that hardly can bee changed. Therefore as there was a time in which the names of the heathen were vnknowen, and yet by the obſtinatee endeuours of ſome, when they were begun, they were receiued and ſo continued: euen ſo, if any man would begin himſelfe thus to ve <hi>the name of the Lords day,</hi> though he were alone at the firſt, I doubt not, but in a fewe generations the true and holy name ſhould be receiued among vs.</p>
            <p>But to returne to that which we ſpake of before, wee haue plainly ſeene, that the day and the <hi>name</hi> ought thus to bee <hi>changed,</hi> whereby the Sabbath is made now ſo much the more excellent and renowmed vnder the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, then it was in the time of the law, becauſe that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the one caried vpon it indeed the badge of the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world, which made it famous, vpon this is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen the liuely Image of the redemption of the world, which maketh it ſo much the more famous, by howe much the benefite of the one exceedeth the benefite of the other: not onely that, but it freſhly repreſenteth the memorie of the firſt creation alſo, and ſo by a double marke is more highly commended, that being the very day in which the creation of the firſt and olde world was begun, and the day wherein the redemption, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and the newe world was ended. Euen as not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Iustine Martyr</hi> doth ioyne both theſe together, when hee ſheweth that in his time the Church did publikely meet vpon this day,<note place="margin">Iustin.

               </note> 
               <hi>doth becauſe it was the firſt day wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God beganne to make the world, and alſo becauſe vpon that day Ieſus Chriſt our Sauiour did riſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dead:</hi> but alſo Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> ſpeaking many excellent things in the commendation of this day,<note place="margin">Auguſt de te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p. ſerm. <hi>251.</hi>
               </note> ioyneth theſe together, <hi>It is apparant that this day is famous in the ſcriptures, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was the firſt day of the world, and the day of Christs reſurrection.</hi> And ſo the memory of the one doth not
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:13563:31"/> put out the glory of the other, but being added vnto it, as a further honour, doth increaſe the dignitie of it ſo much the more: euen <hi>as Iacob was more renowmed of God when he was alſo called Iſraell.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.28.</note> Thus we doe conclude this matter in one word, that this very day which the Church obſerueth in all places, is that which muſt endure to the end of the world, as hauing his authoritie not from man but from God himſelfe, and is that very day, which is now commended vnto vs in the commandement.</p>
            <p>And now all theſe things being thus premiſed (which of neceſſitie muſt firſt haue beene ſpoken of:) the order and time, and my purpoſe requireth, that I ſhould accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your expectation proceede in the wordes of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement it ſelfe, as it was firſt pronounced by the Lord fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; after written by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the 20. chap. of Exodus, ver. 8.<note place="margin">Diuiſion of the text into the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement and the reaſons of it.</note>

But afterwardes, when the Lorde gaue vnto the Iewes the ceremoniall law, hee appointed alſo vnto them certaine other daies in the yeare, as appeareth in the bookes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and is well knowne vnto men, in which he commanded them to reſt, and to keepe them holy: therefore they hauing the nature of the firſt and <hi>onely Sabbath,</hi> are called in the ſcriptures <hi>Sabbath daies:</hi> as the yearely day of purifiyng and clenſing the people, as it is ſet downe in Leuiticus,<note place="margin">

               <hi>Let no man therefore condenme you in meate and drink, or in reſpect of an holyday, or of the newe Moone, of the Sabbaths:</hi> ſpeaking of many in the plural number, where hee proueth that Chriſt hath ſet vs free from all the ceremonies of the Iewes, and that they are in no wiſe to be a dioyned vnto the Goſpell, in ſo much that we are not bound to that diſtinction of meates and daies, that they were: no not of the <hi>Sabbath daies,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to keepe that one which we do, in that manner, and to that end, that they did in euery point, neither to keepe the other <hi>Sabbath dayes</hi> at all which they had. Thus ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, the name of Sabbath was giuen vnto euery day of reſt, but principall, and in it owne nature, it noted out that Sabbath day, which was the ſeuenth, and more improperly by a tropicall ſpeech, that was made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all the other.

For if the wiſedome of a man bee diſcerned, in that his words be proportionall vnto his matter, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee know the matter is waightie, when his words are many: then much more muſt we be perſwaded, that the holie ſcripture was written by ſuch a heauenly wiſedom, that it containeth not a confuſed heape of vaine and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable wordes, and that it is full of idle repetitions, (which were blaſphemie to thinke) but that the Lorde hath in wiſedome tempered his ſpeech for our good, and framed it to our capacitie: and therefore foreſeeing the pronenes of our nature to breake out in this Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, hath ſet vp ſo many barres (as it were) againſt vs, and doth thus beate that into our eares, which we are ſo vnwilling to heare, and more loth to followe. And here, (that I might not ſeeme tedious vnto you) let vs in one worde conſider of that, which is in this ſame chapter ſpoken of the ſeuenth day it ſelfe, &amp; therfore no excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can bee made againſt it in the 3.<note place="margin">

Thus wee haue hetherto ſeene concerning this matter, not onely that the Lord requireth in this Commandement, that we ſhould reſt vpon the ſeuenth day, but how neceſſarily he requireth it of vs, and what great care we ought to haue of it, and that it is a greater ſinne to work vpon that day, then it is taken to be, and that it is not an indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thing

            <p>The reaſon why the Lord would haue men to reſt vpon this day, is manifold:<note place="margin">The chiefeſt cauſe of reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that we might wholly attend vpon Gods worſhip</note> the firſt and principall is that which was from the beginning, that men <hi>might be the more fit to ſanctifie it in the holy ſeruice of God,</hi> which becauſe they could not doe with all the powers of their ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, as the worſhip of God requireth, ſo long as they are about their worldly buſineſſe (becauſe they muſt needes take vp their wits and their willes, the vnderſtanding and the heart either in whole or in part, ſo long as they bee conuerſant in them) therefore that wee might ſo doe as hee requireth, hee would haue vs reſt from that, which might hinder vs from it: and becauſe the affayres of this world, and his worſhip are two diſtinct things, he would haue vs reſt from the one, that we might bee occupied in the other.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:13563:35"/> that is, a day of reſt, and this reaſon, as it did ſtraightly binde <hi>Adam</hi> to reſt vpon it, ſo doth it all his poſteritie much more.</p>

            <p>This portion of holie ſcripture doth ſhew vnto vs, that certaine workes may be done vpon the Sabbath (and in part what they are): therefore as from this and ſuch like places, wee doe rightly take libertie vnto our ſelues, to worke in certaine caſes vpon the Sabbath, ſo we muſt be warie that we take no other libertie, then that which the word affoordeth, if we be deſirous in good conſcience to approue our ſelues before God, and to iuſtifie our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the ſight of men: ſo that wee may not vnder this pretence preſume that euery thing is lawfull, becauſe ſomething is permitted, abuſing Gods liberalitie, and our owne libertie, turning it into carnall licentiouſnes, &amp; worldly prophanenes. But (ſeeing we haue heard in how many places, and how ſtraightly the Lord requireth that all men ſhould reſt) wee might bee aſſured that the thing which wee doe, is of the nature of thoſe which are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto vs, and that we haue good ground for it, not raſhly aduenturing vpon things, and doing them at all aduenture (as it were) and becauſe wee our ſelues in our
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:13563:58"/> owne corrupt reaſon, haue ſo conceiued of them.</p>
            <p>Therefore we ſhall learne out of this ſcripture, what things may lawfully bee done of vs, without the breach of the commandement <hi>of rest.</hi> Firſt of all ſuch bodily la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are permitted,<note place="margin">As that which directly pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the ſeruice of God.</note> as doe immediatly and directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the worſhip of God, and without the which hee cannot be ſerued of vs according to his worde: For this cauſe it was permitted vnto the Prieſts, nay they were commanded to ſley beaſts, and to prepare them for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and offer them vp according to the lawe, about the which they tooke ſo much the more paines vpon that day, then vpon any other of the week, by how much the ſacrifices were increaſed: for beſides the daily ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,<note place="margin">

Thus we doe grant, that <hi>men may trauaile to the places of Gods worſhip,</hi> where the publike aſſemblies and meetings of the Church bee, becauſe otherwiſe they cannot ioyne with them in the communion of the worde, ſacraments, and prayer, and though they be farre diſtant in ſituation of dwelling from the common place of meeting, yet it is permitted vnto them to trauaile by land, or by water, on horſebacke, or on foote thereunto, nay they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to doe it, and they may not vnder the colour of a long iourney tary at home idly taking their eaſe. For euen as the ſlaying of beaſts, is meerely in it owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:13563:58"/> a worldly and bodily labour, yet the Temple which was ſanctified did change the nature of it, and made it holy: ſo to trauaile and to ride, or goe to and fro vpon the Sabbath is altogether painefull, and laborſome to the body, but to take this paines, to preach or to heare the word, maketh it an holy worke, and is warranted by the ſcripture: as in this very place, wee ſee how our Sauiour Chriſt and his diſciples trauaile from towne to towne to preach the Goſpell, and take ſuch paines, that they are hungrie and faint in the way.</p>
            <p>In like manner that all things might be done in order and comelines in the Church (as it is meete) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the whole congregation might meete together at one time, there muſt be ſome notice giuen of it to the people by the ſound of ſome thing:<note place="margin">And loring bels to call me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Church.</note> For the which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as the trumpets and hornes of the Prieſts and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites were ordained vnder the law: ſo we haue the <hi>ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of belles</hi> amongſt vs. Therefore I do not ſee how the common iangling of belles that is vſed in too many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the diſordered ringing at other times of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and for other ends, ſhould bee a worke of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and how it can then be iuſtified, yet the ringing of one bell according to the cuſtome of the place at one time, and the ſame or ſome other at another time, to call the people together, that they might come with one conſent (as it were one man) (which meeting would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe be ſcattered and confuſed) that ſo all might bee preſent at the ſeruice of God fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, &amp; as it is rightly called common prayer, ſo it might be common to all indeede, and not priuate to a few, this ende maketh the labour acceptable vnto God, &amp; though it be a worke, yet it hindereth not the obſeruing of <hi>the rest,</hi> commanded vpon that day.<note place="margin">And to prepare neceſſary and conuenient foode for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Moreouer, God hath giuen to men libertie vpon this day, to prepare that food which is meete and conuenient for euery one, that their bodies being thereby comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:13563:59"/> refreſhed through Gods bleſſing, they might bee the rather thereby ſitted vnto the cheerefull proceeding in his ſeruice, which otherwiſe through their weaknes, might faint, and giue ouer in the mids of it, for ſuch is our nature, that we ſtand in need of a continuall repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by the creatures, &amp; that euery day: therfore though (as wee haue ſeene) the buying and ſelling of victuals, and carying of them to and fro was forbidden, ſeeing that the other ſixe dayes are giuen vnto men for theſe purpoſes, yet the preparing of them, and making them ſeruiceable for the vſe of man, according to the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of euery one, is that which cannot bee done at other times, and yet men cannot want it, if they fruitfully hold out in ſanctifiyng the Sabbath vnto the ende, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this maketh it lawfull vnto all men, when they doe it in that manner, and meaſure that may moſt of all fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them in Gods worſhip, which is the chiefeſt thing vpon that day to be conſidered, and vnto the which all other things ought to be referred.

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:13563:61"/> creatures: and therefore it muſt bee ſo obſerued, as may be moſt beneficiall vnto them, and <hi>the reſt</hi> in it muſt giue place to them, and not they to it: ſo that it were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the meaning of the law-giuer to abuſe <hi>the reſt</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hurt of them, and that men ſhould vnder the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of reſting, withdrawe all their labour from them, who by preſent neceſsitie did call for it, and require it at our hands.</p>
            <p>For ſeeing that the end of it is, that the creatures might bee preſerued in their beſt eſtate (which without ſome reſt, could neuer long continue) if now by labouring I preſerue that, which otherwiſe, if I reſted from helping it, would periſh, I haue by labour attained vnto the very end <hi>of reſt,</hi> which without labour I could not: and thus in labouring I haue not broken the commandement of <hi>reſt,</hi> but kept it in one of the principall ends for which it was inſtituted: namely, the profit and commoditie of all the creatures here belowe. In which reſpect our Lorde Chriſt maintaineth the doing of his Diſciples in gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the corne, and eating it, for that thereby their fraile and wearie bodies being refreſhed, and getting new ſtrength (which otherwiſe would haue fainted, as wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their ordinarie food) were made ſtronger, and more able to follow their maſter. Now, ſeeing that the Lord in commaunding to reſt, had regarde to his creatures, that could not want it, namely, that the breaſts might be made more ſeruiceable vnto men, and men more fit to doe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties vnto their brethren, and vnto God in their calling, becauſe his Diſciples were fitted vnto this by that labour, which neceſſitie put vpon them, and if they had not ſo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured, they ſhould haue been more vnfit: therefore in this worke the commandement of reſting was not bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, nay it was eſpecially obſerued.</p>
            <p>Thus as we haue ſeene the commandement of reſting is ſo ſtraight indeed, as it ſeemed beſt vnto his wiſedom, who made all things for himſelfe, yet in giuing it, he hath
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:13563:62"/> had regard vnto our good: and therefore hath made it ſo large, that within the compaſſe of it, there is libertie giuen vs to doe all ſuch things, as doe not directly hinder the ſanctification of the Sabbath: or if they bee againſt it in their owne nature, yet neceſsitie that could not bee fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene, nor deferred, crauing them at our hands, they are iudged to be farre vnlike vnto themſelues, and haue as it were a new qualitie put vpon them: And here is the olde prouerbe of the heathen true: <hi>Neceſſitas non habet ferias:</hi> Neceſsitie as it is without lawes, ſo without holie daies. And though it bee ſo that we are giuen to take too much libertie to our ſelues, and therefore had neede to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained vnto the full, and it were more profitable for vs to heare from what things wee ſhould reſt, then wherein wee may labour, yet there is a trueth in all things, which muſt bee knowne: and though ſome are readie to abuſe it, yet therefore it muſt not be kept from them, who haue care rightly to vſe it. For though they that bee ignorant, will be ignorant ſtill, <hi>yet wiſedome ſhall be iustified of her children.</hi> Which is to be conſidered of vs the rather, leaſt any through a groſſe ſuperſtition, ſhould fall into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie of the Iewes: of whom it is written, and namely of certaine heretikes called <hi>Eſſaei,</hi>

            <p>And that I might not be tedious in ſo plaine a matter, (though my purpoſe bee to ſpeake moſt profitably, and therefore tarrie in it the longer) I will ſhewe you the like in a caſe, that I haue had experience of my ſelfe,<note place="margin">2 Another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</note> when I did once dealt with one for labouring vpon the Sabbath, &amp; namely, for waſhing hempe out of the water, in which it had been layd a rotting: the partie anſwered me, that it could tarrie no longer, but muſt needs then be drawne out, otherwiſe all ſhould be loſt: which whether it be ſo or no, I leaue it to bee iudged of others (for I confeſſe I haue no great skill that way my ſelfe) yet by further ſpeech, finding that they know how many dayes it muſt lye in the water, I ſayd vnto him, that they might haue preuented it, if they would haue <hi>remembred the Sabbath,</hi> and therefore to haue counted their dayes, and put the hempe into the water, that they might haue drawne it out againe one or two dayes before, or after the Sabbath.

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:13563:66"/> and allured to ſerue our God ſo much the more, ſeeing he commandeth vs not thoſe things which might ſeem ouer bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and painefull vnto vs, but hath a due regard to our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and abilitie, therefore when he beareth with vs after this manner, and leaueth vnto vs our profits and commodities, ſo much more diſſolute, wicked, and inexcuſable are wee, if we be not inflamed to yeeld our ſelues wholly vnto him. Thus farre Master Caluin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See then what an impudency and rebellion this is, that men are growen vnto: the Lord ſayth, <hi>In ſixe daies they may doe all their worke,</hi> and therefore willeth them to reſt vpon the ſeuenth: and they moſt wickedly crie out as loud, with more then a whoriſh face by their ſpeeches and practiſes, <hi>that in ſixe daies they cannot doe all their worke,</hi> and therefore they take vp alſo all our part of the ſeuenth: what a crueltie then is this that they charge the Lord withall, that he ſhould bind them vnder the paine of eternall condemnation to reſt vpon the ſeuenth day, and yet ſhould not giue them ſufficient time vpon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dayes to end their worke in? which once but to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine were horrible impietie. But let vs iuſtifie the Lord in his mercie, and confeſſe as the truth is, that wee ought ſo much the more carefully to <hi>remember the Sabbath,</hi> to reſt vpon it, becauſe <hi>in the ſixe daies wee may doe all our worke,</hi> if wee will pray vnto God for wiſedome in our calling, and ſo we ſhall be deliuered from that <hi>neceſſitie</hi> of working many times, which otherwiſe we doe volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily pull vpon our ſelues. Thus wee may conclude this point, that ſeeing the Lord of his great liberalitie, euen vpon that day wherein hee requireth our reſt moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely, hath not caſt vs into that bondage, that we ſhould doe nothing at all, but hath left vs that freedome that in needfull things we may labour, it ſtandeth vs in hand ſo much the more carefully to looke to our ſelues, that wee be ſure the things we go about could not haue bin done before, not deferred any longer: and therefore were
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:13563:67"/> neceſſary to be done at that time, which when wee bee throughly perſuaded of by Gods word, then may wee in faith and a good conſcience take them in hand, knowing that the Lord exempteth vs as it were at that preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, from the generall lawe of reſting, and by ſome ſpeciall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion calleth vs to worke, and therefore wee doe it, as vnto him.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Works of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie vpon the Lords day muſt not be done for gaine but of mercy and pitie.</note>In which conſideration, wee ought not to take any thing for our worldly labours vpon the Sabbath, and we ſhould not make a gaine of our trauaile vpon that day if neceſſitie driue vs vnto it, for we do it not as a worke of our calling, from the which wee muſt ceaſe, nor as that by the which wee get our liuing, with which wee muſt not meddle) but only becauſe ſome of the creatures doe ſtand in neede of our helpe, for whoſe preſeruation the day of reſt is appointed, and therefore in pitie and compaſſion vnto them, we yeelde them our labour and doe it as <hi>a deed of mercy,</hi> and vnto the Lord. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though that conſtitution of <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 9.<note place="margin">

            <p>And this is that indeed which commonly men do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend when they are charged with their needleſſe trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, that it was a good deed to help ſuch a one in miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and it did lye vpon his vndoing, and hee could not but doe it <hi>for very pitie,</hi> and a great deale more they can ſay for themſelues. Therefore let it appeare by their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that nothing mooued them <hi>but pitie,</hi> and that of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſcience to relieue the neceſſity of others, thy were
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:13563:67"/> mooued vnto it, by not onely not receiuing, <hi>but not loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for any reward of men,</hi> no more then you doe of the almes which you giue, and for viſiting the ſicke, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, that ſo it may be counted as an holy worke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, when you doe it, not reſpecting your owne profite in it, but onely the good of others. Therefore let the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, or chirurgian, and ſuch as attend vpon the ſicke, or are any wayes imployed about him, take nothing for their paines vpon the Sabbath; but let them doe it freely, that it may be <hi>a gift</hi> and not accounted as a work of their calling, but a <hi>deede of loue,</hi> and the apothecarie though he receiue money for his ſtuffe, yet let his labour be free. The like muſt be vnderſtoode of all other works of neceſſitie: And therefore if the lawyer, counſellor, or ſergeant will needs trauaile then about his clients cauſe, let him doe it onely <hi>for Gods ſake,</hi> and not bee occupied about it, as a worldly thing, and a <hi>matter of gaine,</hi> for that is proper to the ſixe daies, in the which God would haue them <hi>in the ſweat of their face to eate their bread.</hi>

And generally as our eſtate is better then of the Iewes, in regard of the whole worſhip of God, which is now more euident, ſhorter, not ſo compound, more ſignificant, and with leſſe difficultie; ſo vpon the Sabbath, becauſe the whole worſhip is to be performed, in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of that alſo, great are our priuiledges aboue

            <p>Vnto all which if I ſhall adde this, in the laſt place, I will make an ende of this matter, that beſides theſe great priuiledges, which we haue ſpoken of, Chriſt Ieſus in the Goſpel, hath offered vnto vs ſomewhat more, euen in this commandement that we haue now in hand:<note place="margin">4 And from the obſeruation of many other Sabbaths which they had.</note> That though wee bee reſtrained vpon this day from worke both hand and foot, as the Iewes were, yet haue we libertie to work vpon many other.

And though there were many other cauſes of ordaining the day of reſt, (as we haue alreadie ſeene) yet none ſo chiefe and principall as this: For <hi>Adam</hi> being in paradiſe, whiles he had not yet ſinned, though he was therefore exempted from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

And as it is a ſin not to be carefull of the Sabbath, that we might reſt vpon it, ſo it is a greater ſinne not to obſerue it, that it might be a Sabbath vnto the Lorde by ſanctifying of it: and if for want of heedfulnes any thing do compell vs to worke vpon the day of reſt, it is our ſinne in not marking the Sabbath day: ſo if by our negligence we cannot ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the day of reſt vnto the Lorde, it is a greater ſinne of not <hi>reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring to keepe it holy,</hi> which is the firſt &amp; great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thing in this commandement.</p>

            <p>And now we may more plainely vnderſtand the great neceſſitie of that preciſe reſt, which hath beene ſo often ſpoken of, and is ſo hardly receiued, euen for becauſe that otherwiſe we cannot ſo <hi>keepe it holy vnto the Lord, as we ought to doe:</hi> For this is the law of things conſecrated vnto the Lord, that they may not otherwiſe be imployed, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to his vſe, &amp; they muſt not be partly his, &amp; partly ours, but altogether his, if they be holy to him: therfore ſeeing the day muſt bee hallowed, it muſt not be vſed in other affaires, ſauing in the lords buſines, &amp; it muſt not be part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>And this was a thing not peculiarly belonging to ſome one day, but generallie commanded, and practiſed vpon euery Sabbath day: namely to haue <hi>holy meetings,</hi> that the <hi>day might be kept holy.</hi> And indeed, it was ſo inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably adioyned vnto the Sabbath, that it was not onely ordinarie vpon the ſeuenth day, which is onely properly called the Sabbath, but vpon all other feſtiuall dayes of the Iewes, commanded by God vnto them to obſerue, (which had alſo the nature of the firſt, and true Sabbath) as appeareth moſt plentifullie in this one forenamed chapter of Leuiticus in many verſes, where their ſeuerall feaſtes are reckoned vp: of which as he afterwards ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in particulars,<note place="margin">

            </p>

            <p>And here, becauſe wee ſpeake of the Lords ſeruice, which onely ſanctifieth the day, wee muſt conſider,<note place="margin">All theſe parts of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice muſt be performed with our whole hearts, and not onely outwardly, &amp; of a cuſtome. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4 24.</note> that <hi>he is a ſpirit, and therefore will be worſhipped of vs in ſpirit and in trueth:</hi> and therefore in all the aboue named parts of his worſhip, we muſt performe a ſpirituall obedience, if we will ſerue him: ſo that whenſoeuer the word is read, preached, or heard, the Sacraments miniſtred, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and prayers made vpon the Sabbath of cuſtome, and not for conſcience ſake, becauſe we would doe as others doe, and would not be noted to be ſingular, and ſo in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe things, we, as it were, doe them not: <hi>For hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring we vnderstand not, reading we conceiue not, praying we deſire not,</hi> and all is done <hi>in the letter, and not in the ſpirit:</hi> wee ſerue our ſelues rather then God, and ſo though the day bee holie, wee make it not holie to him, and for his ſake. Thus many when they haue ſeemed moſt of all to haue kept holy the day, haue done nothing leſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that. Therefore as wee muſt repent vs of all our hypocriſie in Gods ſeruice, ſo wee muſt at all times endeuour that the holie exerciſes bee not vnhallowed of vs, leaſt the Lords ſeruice being neglected, (which is ſpirituall in al things) we be found breakers of the Commaundement in that very thing, wherein we did moſt of all preſume that wee had kept it: and if the beſt things that wee doe bee thus iuſtly refuſed, what ſhall become of thoſe, which in our owne eyes carrie not that credite with them, much more in the eyes of the Lord, who examineth all things more narrowly?</p>
            <p>Furthermore,<note place="margin">And ſo as by them we may be furthered in our ſaluation.</note> becauſe the Lord in commanding vs to ſerue him, hath not ſo much reſpect to himſelfe, who hath no neede of vs, as to our owne good, which may by this

               <hi>that they came not together with profite.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both miniſter &amp; people muſt ſo behaue themſelues in Gods houſe, that they may depart with profit to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues &amp; others.

               </note> 
               <hi>in this Commandement is included a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: For God promiſeth, that as he hath ſanctified the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth day for his ſeruice, ſo he will thereby ſanctifie them, that rightly keepe it: and therefore the promiſe of this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſhould be a principall motiue to our obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if in all other things we are carefull not ſo much to vſe them, as to vſe them to the beſt aduantage, why ſhould we not put that out to the greateſt gayne, which in it owne nature is moſt gainfull indeede? For ſeeing that there is nothing in the world that hath ſo great a promiſe made vnto it, as the publike ſeruice of GOD, ſhould we not ſo behaue our ſelues in it, that wee might be made partakers of it? And whereas it is bleſſed for our ſakes, with the full treaſure of all Gods graces in this life, and eternall happines in the ende; can it bee but a moſt grieuous ſinne, by our negligence, to ſpoyle it of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and to make it vnprofitable to our ſelues? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though I am not ignorant, that the proper place to ſpeake of the manner of Gods worſhip, is in another
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:13563:98"/> Commaundement (where alſo it hath been handled at large) yet becauſe all things comprehended in the other Commandements, muſt bee practiſed vpon the Sabbath, we muſt vnderſtand that it is not impertinent to this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe: and that <hi>the Sabbath is then onely truely ſanctified, when of Gods worſhip there commeth ſome fruite and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie vnto vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this cauſe the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> telleth the Iewes, that then they ſhall haue truely ſanctified the Sabbath, and made it holie to the Lord, when thereby they are made more able to reſt from vanitie and ſinne both in word &amp; deede, and be made more fit to ſerue the Lord in all due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties afterwards:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eſay.</hi> 58.13.</note> 
               <hi>If thou turne away thy foote from the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, from doing thy will vpon my holie day, and call the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath a delight, to conſecrate it, as glorious to the Lord, and ſhall honour him, not doing thine owne wayes, nor ſeeking thine owne will, nor ſpeaking a vaine word.</hi> Where his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is not that the whole ſanctifying of the Sabbath conſiſteth onely in theſe, as though he would exclude all the Sacrifices, the reading, and the preaching of the lawe, prayer, and the whole miniſterie of that time eſtabliſhed by the Lord, (whereof he ſpeaketh not a word) but he rather aimeth at this, to correct their hypocriſie in theſe things, and to ſhewe them that all was to no purpoſe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe this fruite followed of it, for which cauſe, the whole worſhip of God and the Sabbath was firſt of al ordained. For as when <hi>Dauid</hi> ſayth:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.6.</note> 
               <hi>Sacrifice and burnt offering thou diddeſt not deſire, but mine eares haſt thou prepared: burnt offering, and ſinne offering haſt thou not required: then ſayd I, loe I come to doe thy will, O my God, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of me in the roule of thy booke, for thy law is within my heart.</hi> He doth not ſay that the Lord required no ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and burnt offering at all, (for he had commaunded them in his word) but he teſtifieth that all ſacrifice and all the outward worſhip is nothing accepted, when it is ſeuered from obedience, and when wee thereby are not
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:13563:99"/> made more fit to obey God in all other dueties, euen as it is expounded in another place:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.22.</note> 
               <hi>Hath the Lord as great pleaſure in burnt offerings and ſacrifices, as when the voyce of the Lord is obeyed? Behold, to obey is better then ſacrifice, and to hearken is better then the fat of rammes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> in the place aboue mentioned, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding the lawe (as it was the chiefeſt office of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet) preacheth vnto them the true interpretation of it, that though all Gods ſeruice bee obſerued in euery out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward poynt vpon the Sabbath, yet all is ceremoniall without theſe fruites, appearing in vs afterwards; neither is it done in that manner, that GOD alloweth, or that they thereby could looke to inherite that promiſe, which in the ſame place hee maketh to them that ſhall truely keepe holie the Sabbath. And thus are all other places to bee vnderſtood, which are of the like nature in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and others; neither doe they proue, that to reſt from ſinne, is a proper duetie of this Commandement, more then any other, to which purpoſe they are alleadged of ſome (that I may ſpeake it with their fauour) but onely ſhewe what ſhould bee the fruite of theſe exerciſes, both vpon that day, and all other beſides. And therefore in like manner, the ſame Prophet exhorting the Iewes to vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned repentantance for their ſinne, and a diligent care to pleaſe God, framing their liues according to his word in all dueties to his maieſtie, and to their brethren, and then promiſeth all manner of bleſſings vnto them ſo doing, in the midſt of this exhortation once or twiſe ſpeaketh of ſanctifying the Sabbath day, as a chiefe meanes to bring them to this, ſaying: <hi>He that keepeth the Sabbath and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteth it not, and keepeth his hand from doing any ill.</hi> And verſe.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eſay</hi> 56.2.</note> 4. <hi>He that keepeth my ſabbaths, and chooſeth the thing that pleaſeth me, and taketh hold of my couenant.</hi> Wherein as he declareth vnto them, that this is the way to come to this faith and repentance, which hath thoſe promiſes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed vnto them, euen to ſerue God in all parts of his
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:13563:99"/> worſhip vpon the Sabbath: ſo he there requireth this at their hands, that they would in ſuch wiſe ſanctifie the day, that they may be thus altered, and chaunged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
            <p>Whereunto agreeth that, which is in the Prophet Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiell, where he telleth the Iewes, how many meanes the Lord had beſtowed vpon them to doe them good, and yet how vnprofitable they were vnder them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that their ſinne was ſo much the greater, and their puniſhment ſo much the more due, ſpeaking of their forefathers: <hi>I gaue them my ſtatutes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.11.12.</note> 
               <hi>and declared my iudgements vnto them, which if a man doe, hee ſhall liue in them. Moreouer alſo, I gaue them my ſabbaths to bee a ſigne betweene mee and them, that they might knowe, that I am the Lord, that ſanctifie them.</hi> Which mercie of his he continued with their poſteritie, for he ſaid vnto their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the wildernes, verſe 19. <hi>Walke in my ſtatutes, and keepe my iudgements, and doe them:</hi> 20. <hi>And ſanctifie my Sabbaths, and they ſhall be a ſigne betweene me and you, that yee may knowe, that I am the Lord your God, &amp;c.</hi> His mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is that hee offered vnto them life euerlaſting in his holy worde: hee gaue them alſo the Sabbaths, wherein they being wholly, and profitably occupyed in all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of religion, might thereby knowe that the Lorde their God, would by his holy ſpirite worke in them all that faith and obedience, which he required of them, that they might come to life euerlaſting. So then he required of them ſo to behaue themſelues on the Sabbaths, as that thereby they might attaine vnto that, for which he eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally gaue them vnto them.</p>
            <p>But this may bee ſufficient to let vs ſee into ſo playne and eaſie a matter as this, namely, that though we come to the Churche all our life euery Sabbath, and remaine there from the beginning to the ending, yet onely ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes, &amp; no more haue we kept holy as we ought, by how many wee haue been bettered and furthered; (I
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:13563:100"/> meane in the waies of our ſaluation) and made more fit to ſerue God and our brethren thereby:<note place="margin">Here we haue cauſe to repent vs of our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. ming to the Church.</note> what ſhall wee ſay then to all our vnprofitable wandrings to the Church and home againe? And how ſhall we giue an account to the Lord for them? And if the caſe ſtand ſo betwixt the Lord &amp; vs, that many times when we thought our ſelues beſt occupied, euen that is turned into ſin vnto vs, what great cauſe haue we to be truely humbled before him by repentance for our ſinnes, that ſo wee might bee exalted of him in due time?</p>
            <p>And in deede this is ſo great an euill, that wee cannot tell where to make an ende of it. For letting paſſe all the dayes of our vanitie and ignorance, ſpent either in pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie or in the light of the Goſpell, wherein wee were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies vnprofitable in the ſeruice of God: wee may with heauie hearts remember, how many times ſince our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, we haue met in the Church with the leaſt profit that may be, or rather none at all, in reſpect of the meanes that did offer vnto vs ſo great profite: in ſo much that though our profiting in worldly things haue been ſo great, that it may be ſeene a farre off, yet our increaſe in heauenly things is ſo ſmall, or rather none at all, that it cannot bee deſcryed, come as nere as you will. And when as in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, we doe reioyce at the greatnes of our gayne, whether wee looke within the doores or without, in the houſe or the fieldes, to our cattell, or to our goods, onely in ſpirituall matters, (I will not ſay our gayne is ſo ſmall) but our decaye and loſſe is ſo great, that wee haue great cauſe to be aſhamed of it. And though from the markets and fayres, we come not without ſome prouiſion, yet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sabbath (which is the market day for our ſoules) we come home many times, and carrie nothing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we might liue the better the whole weeke following. To be ſhort, though from a common perſon we haue not many times departed without ſome profit, yet from the miniſter of Gods word, euen in that place, where he hath
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:13563:100"/> the greateſt bleſſing of being profitable to others, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny can haue in the world, and none ſo great as hee, wee haue departed, and that vpon the Sabbath, without any profite at all, wherein our ſinne is ſo much the greater, that for the moſt parte, men doe not ſee it, and ſo cannot be grieued for it.</p>
            <p>And what is the cauſe of all this? S. <hi>Augustine</hi> in his time complaineth of many great abuſes in the Churche, which hinder men from profiting (all which and many more are true in our time) when hauing ſpoken before of them that are ranging in the fieldes, when they ſhould be at Church, addeth. <hi>Adhuc, quod detestabilius est.</hi>

            <p>Moreouer, though wee bee ſomething skilfull in the Scripture, we cannot well preſently in the Church ſtand reading euery place that ſhall bee alleaged, leaſt in the meane ſeaſon ſome other moſt neceſſarie doctrine ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlip vs, and we not marking what went before, &amp; follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after, cannot tel to what ende the place was alleaged, and ſo we loſe the profit of it, therefore (dooing our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours to marke the Scriptures alleaged) it ſhall bee profitable for vs afterwards, at home to reade them ouer, when wee ſhall bee more free from diſtraction, and haue more leaſure to doe it conueniently: which is that that is commended vnto vs, by the practiſe of the church in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea, that when <hi>Paul</hi> had preached vnto them Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and had proued him to be that Sauiour of the world that was promiſed,<note place="margin">

            <p>And here I would gladly ſpeake as plainely as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly I might, euen to the capacity of the moſt rude and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, becauſe I know that it is ſo little practiſed of men, that they are not ſo much as acquainted with it, to know

And if we marke our ſelues narrowly, we ſhall finde our vntowardnes this way moſt of al, for when we haue gone cheerfully vnto the church, and there with the reſt of Gods people, behaued our ſelues orderly, becauſe theſe are outwarde things, and in them, it might ſeeme vnto vs, that we haue had to deale but with men, it is that which is not ſo yrkſome vnto vs, and wherunto the wickedeſt man may very eaſily come: but afterwards to take ſome fit time to our ſelues, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wee will ſeuer our ſelues from men, and call ourſelues to an account before Gods iudgement ſeate, for that which we haue heard, and to deale with our owne harts in good earneſt, for the doing or not doing of that which we haue learned, and (caſting off al the cloakes of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie) to lay our hearts naked before God, accuſing our ſelues, where we come ſhort of any thing, praying vnto him for his grace therein, confeſſing our ſinnes that we haue beene rebuked of, crauing the forgiuenes of them, acknowledging his mercy, where we haue receiued any thing, intreating him for the continuance of it, and ſo to depart away either more humbled in our ſelues, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide ſinne more carefully; or comforted in the Lord, to goe on forward in well doing more couragiouſly: this I ſay, as it doth eſpecially builde vs vp in godlines, ſo by due proofe we ſhall find, that without the eſpeciall aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſtance of Gods holy ſpirit, there is nothing more loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome in the world, and more tedious vnto vs.</p>
            <p>And I am aſſured, that it is a thing ſo altogether ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred of the greateſt part of the worlde, that they will

For they purpoſing to paſſe away their time in as much mirth as may bee, and hauing determined to abandon all ſorrowe,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9.10.</note> yea though <hi>ſome be godly and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie,</hi> as far from them as they can, will not thus ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deale with themſelues, leaſt it ſhould make them me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie (as they ſay) and driue them into their dumps: And left happily at any time they might (through Gods mercy towards them) vnwittingly fall (as it were) into this <hi>meditation,</hi> they wil cut off al the meanes that might procure it, and therefore be in merry company (as they call it) continually, that they might not ſo much, as be alone at any time: and if perhaps they be, and ſo this ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creepe them (the Lord ſeeking by all meanes poſſible to doe them good) then fearefully they haſten out of it, as faſt as may be: and for that purpoſe ſome that are of great calling, are contented to maintaine at their charges one or other in their houſes that can beſt feed their humor to be merrie companions, or rather ieſters vnto them, to pull them away from this good, though they will not be at halfe the coſt yearely in making prouiſion for ſome godly bookes and learned preachers, when they haue none of their owne, that might bring them to the beſt mirth, and might ſhewe them wherein the greateſt ioye and ſoundeſt comfort doth conſiſt, euen that, that would endure with them, when all other ſhall forſake them, and moſt of all accuſe them.</p>

            <p>But aboue all, that is moſt notable which is in the 13. part of that Pſalme, where with I will end: <hi>Oh how loue I thy law? it is my meditation continually:</hi> where wee may plainly ſee what is the iudgement of the ſcriptures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this thing, which doe ſo often, and ſo highly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <hi>I haue had more vnderstanding</hi> (ſayth hee) <hi>then all my teachers, for thy testimonies are my meditation:</hi> Wherein he doth aſſure vs, that if we will meditate vpon thoſe generall rules, which wee haue heard out of Gods
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:13563:109"/> worde, wee ſhall many times ſee more cleerely into the trueth of it, then he that preacheth it, at leaſt wiſe more then he expreſſed vnto vs: for by the ſpirite of God we ſhalbe taught to apply it mote particularly to our ſelues, then he did, or could, becauſe wee are moſt priuie vnto our owne eſtates. For as in all liberall Arts and Sciences nothing can be taught ſo plainly, vnto which the ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler by meditation reaſoning about it, ſhall not be able to adde ſomething: and without the which the eaſieſt tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching ſhall ſeeme ſomewhat hard: ſo is it in Diuinitie, that by Gods holie ſpirit, vſing earneſt and diligent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation in the ſcripture, wee ſhall moſt eaſily perceiue how to applie that to our own practiſe, which hath been publikely taught, and none can teach vs to haue ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſundrie vſes of it in our lives and conuerſation as our ſelues, when wee giue our ſelues to the profitable medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Without the which all that we reade and heare is but in a generall and confuſed knowledge:</hi>
               <note place="margin">How vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table men are to themſelues and others, for want of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> wee haue little comfort or edification thereby: eſpecially ſeeing Gods bleſſing is vpon his owne ordinance, and his curſe is vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the neglect of the ſame. This maketh great hearers and great readers, to bee vnprofitable to themſelues and others, becauſe for want of meditation, they knowe not how to vſe their knowledge: thereupon it commeth to paſſe, that many preachers can ſay no more, then they finde in their bookes, (and therefore they toſſe ouer ſo many Commentaries as they doe, that they might haue matter enough) and ſo can go no further: becauſe <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meditation all reading is vaine:</hi> whereas it would mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter aboundant matter vnto their former readings. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, they bring themſelues into a bondage to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that, whatſoeuer their writer ſayes, becauſe they do not meditate vpon it; and they hinder their memories, becauſe they truſt all to their bookes: ſo that if they haue time ſufficient and ſtore of bookes, they are able to
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:13563:110"/> ſpeake with great admiration to the profite of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and yet of the ſame matters can ſcarſely ſpeake to a priuat man vpon the ſudden tolerably to his ecdification and comfort, becauſe he hath but ſpoken it of the booke (as it were) and not laboured to make it his owne by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, and thereby to finde out how he might apply it to his owne vſe, and the benefit of others.</p>
            <p>And this thing is ſo much the more daungerous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath infected alſo many of the beſt ſtudents in the Vniuerſities. Hereupon it commeth to paſſe, that many of the beſt people can ſay no more, then they haue heard, and they will alleadge that thus they haue been taught, but how to vſe that they know not, nay they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a great deale of that which they haue learned. So then (as it is in the common prouerbe) <hi>not the greatest Clerkes are alwaies the wiſeſt men:</hi> nor they that haue moſt knowledge are alwaies fitteſt to gouerne, but they who labour to bring their knowledge into practiſe, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie it vnto the time, by comparing things paſt with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that be preſent, and foreſeeing as much as they can what will followe afterward. So not the greateſt hearers and readers of the word, are the godlieſt men, and like to doe moſt good vnto themſelues and others, but the greateſt <hi>muſers and meditatours</hi> thereupon; and they are like to bee ſo much the more profitable, becauſe that whereas reading indeede doth better our affections, but moſt of al doth increaſe our knowledge, this ſo increaſeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in vs, as that it eſpecially breedeth good affections in vs, and quickeneth them vp moſt effectually, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be begun before, and we know that our affections be (as it were) the feete of our ſoules, and doe more carrie vs to euery thing, then our knowledge.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſeeing the profite of meditation is ſo great, and the neglect of it bringeth ſo great loſſe, it ſtandeth vs in hand (that ſo all the parts of Gods publike worſhip might be as profitable to vs, as they be in their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:13563:110"/> that we ſhould not only prepare our ſelues to them before we come, as wee haue ſeene heretofore, but alſo diligently meditate vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euery thing done in the Church afterwards.

               </gap>eacheth that is, hauing a ſcholer of a moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent wit, very apt to receiue any thing that is taught, yet if he doe not vſe to meditate vpon that, which hath been read vnto him, what great learning can he attaine vnto? nay how little hope muſt there needes be of him? How much more then muſt it of neceſſitie bee, that wee being ſo blind and dull of conceiuing in Gods worſhip, as wee be, ſhould not be vnprofitable partakers of euery thing that is done moſt profitably in the Church, when wee neglect meditation, that is the chiefeſt thing to keepe it, and to bring it vnto profit? Therefore vs be ſorie that in times paſt, we haue made the ſeruice of God vpon the Sabbath day ſo vnprofitable to our owne ſoules (as wee haue done) by neglecting this part of Gods worſhip vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, which as it is moſt worthie in it ſelfe, ſo would haue brought great commoditie to our ſelues: and let vs pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe hereafter that wee will not paſſe away the Sabbath without godly meditations, and that this ſhall bee one thing, wherein will ſpend the time (that we haue free from the publike exerciſe) in meditation of things read and heard before, and let vs pray vnto God for his holie ſpirit, that we may performe our godly purpoſes.</p>

            <p>Therefore to conclude, wee may well perceiue what great reaſon there is, that we ſhould account this to be one of thoſe priuat exerciſes, whereby we ſhould ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Sabbath, and keep it holy, as we are commanded: vnto which wee muſt adioyne as another part of Gods ſeruice,<note place="margin">We ought pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre and talke of Gods word one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> and a moſt excellent helpe of our infrimities, <hi>the conferring and talking with other of that which wee haue

            <p>And indeede the Prophet <hi>Malachie</hi> noteth out the godly in his time, by this marke, that they conferred one with another of the ſcripture, which they had heard, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he thus writeth:<note place="margin">

               <hi>Then ſpake they that feared the Lord e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one to his neighbour, &amp;c.</hi> where, though it be not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely named of what they conferred, yet in the context and words of the Prophet it is eaſily gathered. For wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as hee prophecieth of the preaching of the Goſpell by <hi>Iohn the Baptiſt,</hi> and our <hi>Sauiour Chriſt,</hi> wherein ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is offered to the obedient, and deſtruction threatned to the rebellious, the Prophet ſetteth downe what was the fruite of this preaching, namely, that the vngodly made a mocke of it, whoſe words are firſt of al ſet down and reproued, verſ. 13. <hi>Your words haue been ſtout against me, ſayth the Lord of hoſts, &amp;c.</hi> Afterwards hee declareth what was wrought in the godly, namely, that <hi>they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred of thoſe things diligently among themſelues:</hi> both of the iudgements denounced, that fearing they might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyd them: and of the promiſes, that beleeuing them, they might comforted ouer them, &amp; incourage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to waite vpon God for the accompliſhment of them.

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:13563:112"/> where it is ſayd, that the Lord <hi>liſtened to their conference,</hi> that is, allowed of it, and promiſed to bleſſe them for it: verſ. 16 <hi>And the Lord hearkened and heard it, and a booke of remembrance was written before him, for them that feared the Lord, and that thought vpon his name.</hi> 17. <hi>And they ſhalbe to me, ſayth the Lord of hoſts, in that day that I ſhall doe this, for a flocke, and I will ſpare them, as a man ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his owne ſonne, that ſerueth him.</hi>

Doth not experience teach all men, that thoſe ſchollers are like to proue beſt learned, which will conferre one with another, about that, which the maſter hath read vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them before?

For preſuppoſe they haue the beſt memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the world, yet (hearing a ſtrange thing) if they will neuer tell it vnto others or make reporte of it any more, how can they long remember it? Nay muſt they not needes ſoone forget it?

            <p>And what can we iudge to be the cauſe of this, but that they haue told the one ſo many times to their neighbours and haue gone it ouer and ouer againe, which maketh them ſo cunning in it, and of the other they haue ſcarce once opened their mouthes to ſpeake, and therfore all is ſo cleane forgotten?

            <p>So then, let vs account this <hi>one part of our duetie and ſeruice to Ieſus Chriſt vpon his holie day, to conſider adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly of his workes,</hi> who is now the heire of the whole world, and gouerneth euery thing in it, for the good of his people, that he hath redeemed: ſeeing <hi>all power is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto him in heauen and in earth,</hi> that wee thereby might be more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed in his fauor, more aſſured of his promiſes, and made more fit to ſerue him: Euen as in the ſcriptures,<note place="margin">The ſeruants of God haue greatly profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in faith &amp; obedience by the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> we may ſee many times how the ſpirit of God ſendeth vs to the creatures, to bee confirmed by them in the things that are ſpoken of God in the word, and the ſeruants of God haue by them ſtrengthened their faith in the promiſes, which they had learned out of Gods word before.</p>

            </p>
            <p>So likewiſe the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> in his 33. chapter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:13563:118"/> miſing vnto the church deliuerance out of their trouble, doth perſwade them of the infallible truth of Gods word, herein by ſetting before their eyes the immutable courſe of nature, in the continuall interchange of the day and night: <hi>Thus ſayth the Lord,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The Pſalmes moſt of all are full of this matter, and as it is a booke of practiſe eſpecially, ſo it is plentifull in theſe meditations, and the treatiſe would be long, if I ſhould but in order reckon vp the principall places there, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this purpoſe: yet the waightines of the matter will not ſuffer me to paſſe ouer them all. It is moſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, how <hi>Dauid</hi> in the 8.

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.19.</note> 
               <hi>how excellent is thy name in all the world?</hi> And in another Pſalme the Prophet complaineth of the greatnes of his affliction, and being almoſt diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, becauſe the Lord deferred his helpe ſo long, that he might not vtterly ſink down, vnder the heauie waight of his grieuous tentation,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.10.</note> 
               <hi>ſtrengtheneth his faith by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring Gods former works,</hi> that he might haue hope of his mercie towards himſelfe: <hi>I remembred the yeares of the rtght hande of the moſt high.</hi> 11. <hi>I remembred the workes of the Lord, certainly I remembred thy wonders of

            </p>
            <p>So likewiſe in the 22. Pſalme, the man of God being in ſuch extremitie, that he was almoſt paſt all hope, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with this heauie complaint:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Et.</hi> 21.1.</note> 
               <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me, and art ſo farre from my health, and from the voyce of my roring?</hi> But afterwards commeth to this, verſe 4. <hi>Our fathers trusted in thee, they trusted, and thou didſt deliuer them.</hi> 5. <hi>They called vpon thee and were deliuered, they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.</hi> And then he ſayth, verſ. 10. <hi>I was caſt vpon thee, euen from the wombe, thou art my God from my mothers bellie.</hi> Where we ſee he getteth hope at the laſt, of being heard, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, by the conſideration of Gods workes, both gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally done to his ſeruants in times paſt, and particularly ſhewed to himſelfe heretofore. And there is great reaſon of this, for the Lord is alwaies like himſelfe, and <hi>Ieſus Chriſt is yesterday, and to day, and the ſame for euer:</hi> and therefore will doe as he hath done, for there is no reſpect, either of perſons,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.10.</note> or times with him: but <hi>all the wayes of God are mercie and trueth,</hi> not only mercie in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but trueth in the midſt and ending. For this cauſe the ſeruant of God thus praieth in the Pſalme 119.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Et.</hi> 119.132.</note> 
               <hi>Looke vpon me and be mercifull vnto me, as thou vſeſt to doe vnto thoſe that loue thy name.</hi> And verſ. 149. <hi>Heare my voyce according to thy louing kindnes, O Lord quicken me accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy cuſtome.</hi> In both which places, we ſee how he prayeth to God that he would ſhewe him that mercie, which he was wont to ſhew to him himſelfe &amp; others in the like caſe heretofore, &amp; ſo by the former works of God ſtrengtheneth himſelfe in prayer. Thus wee may eaſilie vnderſtand, what profit we might get by the <hi>earneſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation and wiſe conference about the works of God,</hi> which are done in great wiſedome, thereby to confirme vs in the trueth of thoſe things, that are written in the word, and to draw vs to thoſe dueties that are required of vs in
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:13563:119"/> the ſame, and ſo generally to further vs in all godlineſſe: and therefore a thing not to bee neglected at any time, but moſt of all to bee practiſed vpon the Lords day, that we might leaue nothing vndone, which might make all Gods worſhip moſt profitable vnto vs, and make vs fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnto all other dueties, which is the end why the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was ordained.</p>
            <p>In the 104. Pſalme, the Prophet ſpeaking of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull workes of God, and the marueilous gouerning &amp; preſeruing of them, beginneth thus:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Et</hi> 104.1.</note> 
               <hi>My ſoule praiſe thou the Lord:</hi> and towards the midſt breaketh forth into this ſpeech: <hi>O Lord how manifold are thy workes?</hi>

                  <hi>verſ.</hi> 24.</note> 
               <hi>in wiſedome haſt thou made them all.</hi> And in the end concludeth with, <hi>Glorie be to the Lord for euer.</hi> And 33. <hi>I will ſing vnto the Lord all my life, I will praiſe my God while I liue.</hi> Hereby declaring what ought to bee wrought in all men, by the reuerent co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering of Gods works, and that we ſhould not muſe, or ſpeake of them vnprofitably, but with that glorie vnto God, and comfort to our ſelues, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of vs, and no doubt many of his children doe.</p>
            <p>But that I might drawe to an ende, one word of that, which as it is moſt plaine, ſo it is moſt comfortable, Pſal. 147. <hi>Sing vnto the Lord with praiſe,</hi>

               <hi>ſing vpon the harpe vnto our God, which couereth the heauen with clowdes, and prepareth raine for the earth, and maketh the graſſe to grow vpon the mountaines, which giueth to beasts their food, and to the young rauens that cry.</hi> The whole Pſalme is a Pſalm of praiſe vnto God, for that he watcheth ouer his Church by his eſpeciall prouidence, to doe it good, and declareth the ſame to if, and to none other by his word: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſayth, that the Lord will helpe it, by his infinit wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, when it is confounded in it ſelfe, and knowes not what to doe, and by his omnipotent power will deliuer it, when it is moſt weake in it ſelfe: which he proueth in theſe verſes that wee haue ſeene, by the wiſe and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prouidence of God ouer his creatures, as if hee had
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:13563:120"/> ſayd, God dealeth well with the creatures made for men, much more will be doe good to his Church, whereof he hath the greateſt care: He dooth good to the inſenſible creatures, for when the earth is dried vp in the heate of Summer, and gapeth as it were for extreame thirſt, and the toppes of the mountaines are parched, and euery thing ſeemes withered by the rootes, the Lord heareth as it were the cry of the earth, prepareth raine, and wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the hilles, and ſo changeth their hewe, and maketh them greene and freſh againe: then much more will he renewe the face of his Church, and make it beautifull, though it was deformed, and fullied with extreame mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie and calamitie before. Nay, the Lord feedeth the beaſts, when they are pinched with hunger, and crye for meate, euen the young rauens that cry in their neſts, and muſt needes famiſh there, if the Lord did not moue the heart of the olde one to finde out meate and bring it to them. If he doe ſo much for them, how much more ſhal his eares bee open to the prayers of men, calling vpon him in the name of Chriſt Ieſus, according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>And this is part of that heauenly ſermon, which our Sauiour Chriſt maketh vnto the people in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, as it is recorded by the Euangeliſt S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> where he dehorteth them from too much carefull ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the things of this life, by the ſerious meditation vpon Gods prouidence ouer them, which that he might perſwade them of, he ſheweth it them by experience in thoſe creatures of God, that were common before their eyes:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.25.</note> 
               <hi>Therefore I ſay vnto you be not carefull for your life, what ye ſhall eate, or what ye ſhall drinke: nor for your bodie what you ſhall put on: Is not the life more worth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meate? and the bodie then rayment?</hi> 26. <hi>Behold the fowles of the heauen, for they ſowe not, neither reape, nor carrie into the barnes, yet your heauenly father feedeth them. Are you not

Learne how the lillies of the field doe grow: they labour not, neither ſpinne.</hi> 29. <hi>Yet I ſay vnto you, that euen Salomon in all his glorie was not arayed like one of theſe.</hi> 30. <hi>Wherefore if God ſo clothe the graſſe of the field, which is to day, and to morrowe caſt into the ouen, ſhall he not doe much more vnto you, O ye of little faith?</hi> 31. <hi>Therefore take no thought, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what ſhall wee eate? or what ſhall we drinke? or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhall we be clothed.</hi> 32. <hi>For your heauenly father know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that ye haue neede of all theſe things.</hi> 33. <hi>But ſeeke ye firſt the kingdome of God and his righteouſnes, and all theſe things ſhall be ministred vnto you.</hi> In all which words we ſee, how he draweth his exhortation from the creatures, to teach vs, that we ſhould not bee idle, and vnprofitable beholders of them, but as the Lord doth moſt cleerely manifeſt himſelfe vnto vs in them, ſo wee (beſides the preſent vſe of them) ſhall open our eyes to behold, that which the Lord dooth offer vnto vs by them. For this cauſe the Lord himſelf, <hi>after he had made the whole world in ſixe dayes, and rested the ſeuenth,</hi> that by his owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample he might ſtirre vp mankinde, to meditate vpon that wonderfull great frame, and euery thing in it, that he might giue the glorie vnto God, that was due to him for it, and ſerue him carefully, that had ſo wonderfully prouided euery thing for him.</p>
            <p>But I knowe not how it hath come to paſſe, through the great corruption and blindnes that is within vs, that in theſe things wee doe not ſeeke after God,<note place="margin">

               <hi>though by them we might haue groped after him, and found him.</hi> Nay, a great many are like vnto the oxe and the aſſe, who haue the vſe of Gods creatures, and are filled with them, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drinking and taking their caſe, yet neuer lift vp their mindes vnto him, that ſends them to that end, that thereby they might inquire after him, who is the author of them: But contenting themſelues with thar profit and pleaſure they haue in them, are ſo drowned and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:13563:121"/> therewith, that whereas they ſhould be guides to direct them more ſurely to the Lord, and glaſſes to them to ſee him more cleerely, they thereby are either turned out of the way, and go further from him, or make them vailes before their eyes looking onely vnto them, and not vnto the Lord that is in them. For wee ſhall ſee men (that are muſing vpon their cattell, and vpon their ground the whole day) to be ſo earthly minded, that they will altogether ſticke faſt in them, and be as it were fette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto them ſo, that they are not able to lift vp their mindes to any heauenly meditation from them, but like beaſts are ſtill groueling vpon the earth, and haue their mindes either wicked and prophane, or vaine and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh. And ſuch ſhall be their communication of them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther finding fault at the workes of the Lord, or ſcoffing at them, or fondly iangling about them, or after a meere worldly manner ſpeaking of them, which plainly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how barren they are within of any profit they reape by them. And if it be not ſo, what is the meaning of theſe and ſuch like ſpeeches, that are ſo rife in the mouthes of men? Here is a deare yeare, it is an hard winter, this is a ſore froſt, here is a great drought, this raine is like to make a floud, &amp;c. (becauſe I will not ſo much as name the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious ſpeeches of the Atheiſts) which when they haue vnaduiſedly caſt forth, then they can ſay no more. Whereas they ſhould in theſe things ſee the iudgements of God againſt ſinne, that they might bee drawne to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: euen as in the reſt of his dealings, they ſhould behold his mercies, that they might bee encouraged to ſerue him: and ſo ſpeake of them, that they might make theſe things knowne vnto others.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods workes, will teach vs to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by al things and in all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates.</note>Therefore if men will needes ouerlooke their grounds vpon the Lords daye (as ſometimes they muſt) and bee dealing with their cattell, &amp; talking about them, let their cogitation and ſpeeches tend to this ende, and then in ſo dooing they may ſanctifie a part of the daye, otherwiſe

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:13563:122"/> 
               <hi>the ſunne of righteouſnes ariſing in our hearts?</hi> How might the ſpring of the yeare, put vs in minde of our regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and new birth? What would the darkenes of the night teach vs, but the horror and feare of ignorance, where there is not Gods worde? Would not our meate leade vs to the ſpirituall foode of our ſoules? And our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell to the righteouſnes of Chriſt Ieſus, that being clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed therewith, wee might bee comely before God and men, and not aſhamed. And to be ſhort, if we were not beaſtes and no men, might not our ſleepe forewarne vs of death, our bedde of the graue, our riſing againe in the morning of the day of our reſurrection? Thus al the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſhould lift vs vp to the creator, and thus to be occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed about them, are the very works of the Sabbath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede. Thus if we did ſee or heare any of the iudgements of God vpon our ſelues or others, wee ſhould thinke and ſpeake of them with humilitie and feare: of any of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites, with great ioy and comfort, whereas now men for the moſt part doe neither the one, nor the other.</p>
            <p>And though I know very wel that the proper place to ſpeak of theſe things is in the third co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, where the Lord willeth vs in al our thoughtes, wordes &amp; deeds to ſeeke and ſet forth his glorie, and therefore ſo alwaies to deale with his creatures, that his moſt glorious name might appeare thereby; <hi>For he is the creator of all things, and this is his name:</hi> yet to doe them vpon the Sabbath is the very worke of that day, in which we ſhould vſe all the meanes that might make the publike miniſtery moſt profitable vnto vs, and either drawe vs nearer vnto God, or make vs more fitte to doe dueties to our brethren. Therefore let vs ſet our hand to this trueth, &amp; confeſſing that it is our bounden dutie to ſerue God in this right vſe of his creatures, and workes, let vs be ſorrowfull that wee haue ouerſlipped this duetie ſo careleſly heretofore, and let vs bee aſſured that it hath bereaued vs of much godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that otherwiſe might haue been in vs, and made vs
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:13563:122"/> ſo much the leſſe profitable vnto others: and therefore in the feare of God, and in the care of our own Saluation let vs purpoſe, &amp; performe this duetie moſt carefully hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that the bleſſing of God might be more vpon vs, and we haue the teſtimonie of a good conſcience, &amp; of Gods creatures witneſſing for vs, and not againſt vs.</p>
            <p>And let vs be ſo much the more carefull of it in good earneſt,<note place="margin">But all ſortes doe greatlie fayle in it.</note> by how much we knowe too well that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practiſe of moſt men is ſo farre from it: In ſo much that euen they of the <hi>vniuerſitie</hi> that make it their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſearch out the nature of Gods workes, and to ſee furtheſt into them, and therefore muſt needs haue many and deepe meditations, beſides often and long diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about them, doe not ſo much as propounde this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelues, and therefore no maruell, if they neuer at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto it, namelie to beholde in them the inuiſible things of God &amp; Gods wonderfull work in them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by either to be confirmed in any part of his word, or ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp to any duetie vnto God or men: but they haue in ſtead of theſe, many both vaine and too curious, and alſo falſe and vntrue diſcourſes about theſe with themſelues and others, euen vpon the Sabbath. And I am ſure that in the countrey men are not free from this ſinne: for it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out in them, euen of the better ſorte, either of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or negligence, that when they haue ſanctified the Sabbath in ſome other part of Gods worſhip, this hath not been ſo much as once thought of.

            <p>But I cannot forget, and paſſe ouer with ſilence that part of Gods ſeruice, which though it be moſt excellent in it owne nature, acceptable vnto God,<note place="margin">There ought to be ſinging of Pſalmes in the Church, and in mens houſes.</note> and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our ſelues, yet it is finally regarded euery where, and that is the <hi>ſinging of the Pſalmes.</hi> Of which I rather ſpeake in this place then in the former, becauſe though I know there ought to be ſinging in the Church, and that it is one piece of Gods publike worſhip, and the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of our Church is ſuch (through Gods mercy) that the Pſalmes are ſung in many places, after a plaine, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, and profitable manner, and may be euery where if men will, yet men content themſelues with that, and are not mindfull to ſing at home by themſelues alone, or with the reſt of their houſhoulde: but contenting themſelues that this is receiued in the Church, haue no care to bring it into their houſes; but as though to ſing Pſalmes were proper vnto the Church, doe neglecte this duetie euery where elſe.

            <p>And if we looke into the booke of Pſalmes, we ſhall finde not onely a great many which doe generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the eſtate of the whole Church, and therefore are moſt <hi>fit to bee ſung in the common aſſemblies:</hi> but alſo a great number which doe moſt fitly agree with the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate condition of the ſeuerall members of the Church,<note place="margin">To this end is there ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of Pſalmes agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with all times, and all mens eſtates.</note> and that in many things, ſo that there is no man which can be at any time in ſuch a caſe, but hee ſhall ſee it moſt liuely ſet foorth in ſome one Pſalme or other, euen as though it were <hi>made for him to ſing at that very time,</hi> which it may be, agrees not ſo well with others, no nor with himſelfe at any other time; which no doubt are left vnto vs by the ſpirite of God, that wee might <hi>ſing to him as well priuately as publikely.</hi> For this cauſe alſo there is ſuch great varietie of Pſalmes, in ſuch diuers arguments, that whether we will giue thanks for ſome great deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,

            <p>Let vs not therefore deny ſo manifeſt a trueth, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge as the word doth teach vs, that the Lorde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of vs in our priuate meetings vpon the Lordes day, and when we are alone by our ſelues, <hi>to ſing Pſalmes, as well as in the Church.</hi> And though I doe not binde men vnto this, (for bee it farre from me that I ſhould lay any heauier burden vpon any, then the worde of God it ſelf doth) bind them I ſay vnto this; that <hi>in all their mirth
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:13563:125"/> they ſhould ſing Pſalmes,</hi> as it might ſeeme the places al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged doe import. Yet this the Lorde requireth of vs, that in all our lawfull pleaſures we ſhould looke vp vnto him, and ſo reioyce in them, that wee eſpecially reioyce in him, and ſo from them to be led to him, and by them to be made fitter to ſerue him: And whereas it falleth out thus with the wicked, that all pleaſures draw them away from God, take away from them the remembrance of him, and driue them into ſinne, we contrariwiſe ſhould by all of them, come neerer vnto God, ſet him before our eyes, and make our ſelues fitter to ſerue him &amp; praiſe him. For as that is a godly ſorrow that driueth vs to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, a bleſſed heauineſſe, that maketh vs ſeeke vnto the Lord, ſo that is a <hi>godly mirth that endeth with ſinging with Pſalmes,</hi> and an heauenly ioy, that at leaſt wiſe maketh vs more fit to ſerue God. And otherwiſe as we may ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect our ſorow to be but worldly, ſo our ioy to bee but fleſhly, and carnall.</p>
            <p>And this is that whereunto the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Iames</hi> hath reſpect, ſaying, <hi>Is any amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g you afflicted? let him pray: Is any merry?</hi>

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:13563:125"/> can truely pray without the feeling of his wants, ſo no man can ſing from his heart, vnleſſe hee haue ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of Gods fauour, and ſo as affliction driueth him to pray, ſo mirth mooueth him to ſing. Therefore when the Lorde dealeth ſo fatherly with his children, that hee tempereth their afflictions with the ioy of the ſpirit, then he giueth vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iuſt occaſion both to pray &amp; ſing vnto him. Thus we reade that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylas</hi> being in priſon ioyned them together,<note place="margin">

               <hi>At midnight Paul and Sylas pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſang a Pſalme vnto God.</hi> Being firſt of all beaten very ſore, and then caſt into a dungeon with their feete in the ſtocks, it was then time to pray: but conſidering the goodnes of their cauſe, for which they ſuffered all theſe things, and finding the Lord preſent with them, by his fauour aſſuring them of his defence, there was iuſt cauſe of ioy, <hi>and in ioy to ſing as they did.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then, ſeeing to ſing Pſalmes is a part of Gods ſeruice, (as we haue ſeene it in ſo many places of the word com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended vnto vs) it muſt needes be put in practiſe vpon that day which is dedicated to his ſeruice: and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when we conſider that the fitteſt time for it, is <hi>the time of ioy,</hi> and there is no ioy comparable to that which we haue in Chriſt Ieſus: and we neuer inioy that ſo fully, as by the meanes whereby he conueyeth it vnto vs, and we neuer haue all the meanes ſo plentifully, and ſo continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, as vpon the Sabbath. Therefore as the Lord then of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth himſelf wholly vnto vs, and his ſonne Chriſt Ieſus to be made ours, with all his merits in the worde, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments and prayer, and ſo thereby doth fill our hearts with the ioye of the holy Ghoſt, euen <hi>that ioy that is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable</hi> and moſt glorious, ſo then eſpecially we ought <hi>to ſing for ioye of the Lord,</hi> if euer wee will doe it: And not onely in the Church, (which we ought to doe eſpecially, where the greateſt ioy is beſtowed vpon vs) but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by the forenamed priuate exerciſes, this ioye is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, and ſometimes increaſed; wee muſt priuately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue

            <p>And that we might doe it the more cheerefully, let vs knowe for a ſuretie, that though wee cannot ſing at all, where there is no whit of ioy, ſo let this ioy bee neuer ſo little, by ſinging we ſhal increaſe it For euen as al know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is increaſed eſpecially by hearing, reading, and conferring about the ſcripture, ſo all affections are moſt of all ſtirred vp, by meditation, prayer and ſinging of Pſalmes. And becauſe vpon the Lords day we muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to build vp our ſelues in both, wee muſt neglect no meanes whereby we might attaine vnto our full growth in either: Therefore euen then are wee iuſtly puniſhed with deadnes and dulnes vpon the Sabbath, becauſe we neglect al thoſe meanes, or els doe not ioyne them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So then we haue great cauſe to be ſorrie, that wee haue ſo many times neglected this ſeruice of God vpon the Sabbath day: and though wee had not ſpent away the time in a prophane mirth (as many times wee haue done) yet there is great cauſe of humiliation for <hi>not ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vp our ſelues (by ſinging Pſalmes)</hi> vnto that ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall mirth, whereby we might haue been more cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully occupied in Gods ſeruice, and comfortably to our owne ſoules. And let vs not hereafter continue to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke the Lord, and bereaue our ſelues of much comfort by neglecting to ſing.</p>
            <p>But when I ſo earneſtly requeſt this vpon the Sabbath, my meaning is not to exclude it from other dayes, no more then priuat prayer, reading, &amp;c. and the former places of ſcripture haue proued the contrarie, but my purpoſe is to ſhew, that if at any other time it is to bee practiſed, then eſpecially vpon the Lords day. And true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie I am ſo much the longer in this thing, &amp; would faine be as importunate in it, as I might, becauſe, as I knowe it
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:13563:126"/> to bee a thing of great moment,<note place="margin">The ſinging of Pſalmes is greatly decaied in all places, and amongſt al ſorts of men.</note> ſo I haue obſerued it to be greatly neglected in our time, aboue that which had wont to bee at the firſt reſtoring of the Goſpell, and is like to bee leſſe regarded in time to come. For beſides that there bee too many which are of great yeares, that neuer ſung Pſalme in their liues, neither can do, nor haue any care to learne, though they can ſing ſome other vain ſongs very perfectly; and though they cannot reade themſelues, nor any of theirs, yet will haue <hi>many Ballades</hi> ſet vp in their houſes, that ſo they might learne them, as they ſhall haue occaſion: but as <hi>for the booke of Pſalmes,</hi> it commeth not once into their thought to make proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for it. Beſides theſe men, I ſay, of whom it is a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable thing to thinke, we may finde that the neglect of this duetie, hath ouer ſpread it ſelfe farre and neere: for euen amongſt them, which are giuen moſt to ſing, this is the leaſt thing that they doe: and indeed many of the common Singing men are ſo vngodly, that it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for them to haue their mouthes ſtopped, then once to open them to pollute ſuch holy and ſacred ſongs. And as for others, though they haue al varietie of Muſick both vpon Inſtruments and with the voyce, and that euery day, yet many of them very ſeldome, or ſcarſely once a yeare doe heare a Pſalme, ſauing in the Church.</p>
            <p>I doe not finde fault with this kinde of Muſicke, but doe eſteeme of it, as I ought, euen of the moſt exquiſite that may be. I confeſſe it to be the eſpeciall gift of God in any. I knowe it very well to bee commended in the ſcripture, and that it hath had wonderfull effects in time paſt, <hi>as in Saul and Elizeus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.23. 2. <hi>King.</hi> 3.15.</note> and that men might ſtil haue great commoditie by it, if it were rightly vſed: only this I complaine of with griefe, that the beſt Muſicke is not cared for, and that <hi>the ſinging of other things, hath cleane ſhut out in a great many of places the ſinging of Pſalmes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that you might vnderſtand the complaint to be iuſt, you muſt not onely looke into the houſes of great

And indeed I know not how it commeth to paſſe, (but you may obſerue it) that <hi>the ſinging of ballades</hi> is very lately renewed, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth on a freſh againe, ſo that in euery Faire and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket almoſt you ſhall haue one or two ſinging and ſelling of ballades, &amp; they are brought vp a pace, which though it may ſeeme to bee a ſmall thing at the firſt, yet I am greatly afrayd of it. For as when the light of the Goſpell came firſt in, the ſinging of ballades (that was rife in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie) began to ceaſe, and in time was cleane baniſhed away in many places: ſo now the ſudden renewing of them, and haſtie receiuing of them euery where, maketh me to ſuſpect, leaſt they ſhould <hi>driue away the ſinging of Pſalmes againe,</hi> ſeeing they can ſo hardly ſtand together: of which I am ſo much the more iealous, becauſe I ſee that in other places alſo where theſe be not receiued in,<note place="margin">What is the cauſe why ſinging of Pſalmes is ſo decayed.</note> yet the <hi>ſinging of Pſalmes is greatly left,</hi> ouer that it had wont to be.</p>
            <p>But if we would ſearch out the cauſe of this euil diſeaſe in our ſelues and others, that ſo it might bee cured, wee ſhall eaſily finde it in thoſe places of ſcripture, where this duetie hath been commended vnto vs before. For the Apoſtle ſayth to the Epheſians:<note place="margin">

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:13563:127"/> ſongs, ſinging with a grace vnto the Lord in your hearts.</hi> In which places he firſt of all forewarneth vs (vnder one kinde) that we bee not ouerfilled with the pleaſures of this world, but vſe them as though wee were readie to leaue them: otherwiſe wee being wholly giuen to our bellies, and to our backes, ſhall haue pleaſure in nothing but ſuch as will ſerue them, &amp; al heauenly mirth ſhalbe ſorrow vnto vs, as to be called to the word and prayer it ſhall be a vexation vnto vs, and then ſhall we bee moſt merrie, when we are furtheſt off from God, and then (he ſayth) our mirth ſhall be exceſſiue, and beaſtly. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he would haue the word of Chriſt dwel in them plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly, that being perſwaded of Gods fauour, their harts might not bee vainly merrie, but thereby moued to ſing vnto him.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, that they ſhould bee filled with the ſpirit, that ſhould prepare them to ſpirituall ſongs, for in our fleſh dwelleth no good: for as the fleſh hath no taſte of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things, ſo the ſpirit hath no taſte of carnall things: and therefore being filled with the ſpirit, it will ſtirre vs vp to all ſpirituall exerciſes. Therefore it is no maruell that men are ſo barren in this thing, ſeeing that they are ſo drowned with the pleaſures of this life, that they haue no pleaſure but in them, and being too ful of them, there is no roome in their hearts for the word of God, and for his ſpirit (of which they are emptie) and therefore can take no delight in the exerciſes of the word, and of the ſpirit. So then howſoeuer the neglect of this duetie may ſeeme ſmall in our eyes, yet it muſt needs be great, when it <hi>bewrayeth that we are voyd of Gods word, and of his ſpirit, and that we are too much poſſeſſed with the delights of this world,</hi> and ſo lye in ſome one ſinne or other: whereas on the contrarie, then may wee be aſſured, that our deſire is to pleaſe God, that willingly we doe not continue in any ſinne, that wee vſe the creatures and bleſſings of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, that the ſpirit is in vs, &amp; gouerneth vs by the word,

            <p>And in the Chapter immediatlie following when hee had healed a man of the dropſie vpon the Sabbath daye, he proueth the lawfulnes of the fact, by the like reaſon. <hi>It came to paſſe that when Ieſus was entered into the houſe of one of the chiefe Phariſies vpon the Sabbath day to eate bread,</hi>

               <hi>but deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered her from the chaynes of the diuell, with which ſhe had beene long held.</hi> For it is euident in the Goſpell, that (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the infirmitie of her body) there was an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:13563:134"/> worke of Sathan, wherby as ſhe was ſtrangely poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, ſo it wrought in her many ſtrong paſſions, from all which ſhe being deliuered by Chriſt Ieſus, receiued euen in that eſpecialy, the moſt mercy at his hands. Therefore among al the works of God, we muſt be perſuaded that this is none of the leaſt, <hi>to ſhewe mercie vnto the distreſſed ſoules</hi> of our brethren, for this is the mercy of the moſt mercifull, euen Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe, from whom as we haue receiued many great mercies, ſo none to this, that he hath redeemed our ſoules from eternall deſtruction, and when we were ſunke downe into the bottomleſſe pit of all miſery, hee came thither in vnſpeakable loue to fetch vs out, and reconciled vs to his Father, and hath made vs heires of euerlaſting life.</p>
            <p>And let vs be ſo much more mindfull of this duetie, by how much the feweſt in the worlde doe thinke of it, no not they that otherwiſe are mindfull to ſhewe mercy in all outward things.

The like whereof <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaketh of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in that worthie Pſalme 101. which is left as a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne for all Chriſtian gouernours to rule by, wherein he
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:13563:137"/> ſheweth how he would rule not onely himſelfe, but his houſhold, nay the whole kingdome, <hi>by hauing an eye to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that were good, to reward the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that were bad, to puniſh them,</hi> that ſo not only himſelfe, but all his might ſerue the Lord. After the ſame manner in the time of the captiuitie, when the noble Queene <hi>Hester</hi> willed all the diſperſed Iewes to keepe holie three dayes together in faſting and prayer, that ſo they might intreate the Lord, for that finall deſtruction, and vtter raſing of them out, which <hi>Haman</hi> the curſed Amalekite and ſworne enemy of Gods people had determined to bring vpon them ſpeedilie, that it (I ſay) might be preuented in time, ſhe ſayd, <hi>that ſhe and her maydes would doe the like,</hi> Heſt. 4.16. Whereby no doubt ſhe inſinuated vnto them, that in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery houſhold, her meaning was, that it ſhould bee tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly kept on all ſides, not onely the rulers and ſome fewe, but all others euen vnto the maidſeruants.</p>
            <p>Now this is that which we haue ſeene heretofore, that the Sabbath and the day of faſt are both of one nature, and it is that which the word doth ſufficiently beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vnto: therefore if this hath been the practiſe of the Church vpon that day to faſt, not onely of the chiefe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but with their families: then muſt wee needes bee perſwaded, that vpon the Lords day, we ought our ſelues and our houſholds to ſerue the Lord, and to ſay with <hi>Ioſhua, I and mine houſe will ſerue the Lord:</hi> and with <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, I and my ſeruants will doe the like.</hi> And how could that haue been verified of the religious Captaine <hi>Cornelius,</hi> which is written of him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts.</hi> 10.2.</note> 
               <hi>that he was a deuout man, and one that feared God with all his houſhold?</hi> vnleſſe he had not onely frequented the common aſſemblies vpon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath dayes, but had alſo acquainted his ſeruants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Therefore as the Lord himſelfe ſpeaketh of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19.</note> who is the father of all beleeuers, <hi>I know that he will command his ſonnes, and his houſhold after him, that they keepe the way of the Lord to doe righteouſnes and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:13563:137"/> that the Lord may bring vpon Abraham that he hath ſpoken vnto him.</hi> So it muſt bee practiſed of all them that will be children of this faithfull <hi>Abraham,</hi> and enioy the ſame promiſes that he and his poſteritie did, euen that they cauſe their children and their ſeruants to keepe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the Sabbath, wherein conſiſteth the true worſhip of the Lord, that ſo they might walke in that way which hath the promiſes of this life and the life to come. So then by all this it may moſt euidently appeare, both by the words of the commandement, and by the practiſe of the beſt men in the old and new Teſtament, that this duetie is layd vpon all houſeholders, diligently to ouerſee the wayes of their familie, that they ſerue God, as in all other dueties, ſo eſpecially in ſanctifying the Sabbath, as they will anſwere to the contrarie at their perill to him that hath put them in authoritie, and as they will giue an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for their ſoules, which otherwiſe might periſh through their default.</p>
            <p>Which though it bee ſo ſeuerely inioyned in all men,<note place="margin">But in our time it is for the moſt part wholly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</note> and vnder ſo great a paine layd vpon them, yet it is ſo generally neglected of the greateſt part, that we may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther complaine of it iuſtly with griefe, then haue any hope of the ſpeedie reforming of it. For beſides that a great many haue no care to ſanctifie the day themſelues, and therefore cannot with any conſcience require it of their ſeruants and children, but either ſet them to worke or to play, and to do any thing vpon that day, ſauing that which they ſhould, and doe encourage them thereunto by their owne ill example and words: there be others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, who though they ſeeme to haue ſome care to keepe holie the day themſelues (and haue indeede) yet either through ignorance or negligence, do not once looke to their houſholde, whether they come to Church or no, and ſit there attentiuely, and continue there with profit to the ending, nor how they ſpend the reſt of the day: but being demaunded where their ſeruants were, how
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:13563:138"/> chance they came not to Church, &amp;c. they anſwere ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely (and as they thinke ſufficiently) as though it were a thing meerely impertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto them, that they cannot tell, they do not hinder them from the Church, they may come if they will, and they are of age to looke to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and they are paſt boyes now, and I cannot tell what.</p>
            <p>But they muſt conſider beſides that which hath been alreadie ſpoken concerning this matter, that they do too fooliſhly and groſly imagine to ſtoppe (as it were) the mouth of the Lord with that ſimple anſwere in his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which they will not receiue at their ſeruants hands in their owne. For in the ſixe dayes, when their ſeruants are in their owne buſines, they will not let them come and goe at their owne pleaſure, and content themſelues with a bare imagination, that they be at their workes, but will be ſure of it, and therfore ſet them to it, looke vpon them in the doing of it, &amp; call them to an account for it, which if it bee well done in themſelues, becauſe they knowe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they will be negligent, how muſt it not needes then bee a great vnthankfulnes in them vnto God, that vpon his day (which is but one among ſeuen) his ſeruice ſhould be ſo ſlenderly looked vnto, that there is no ſuch diligence vſed towards their ſeruants, that they might performe it? And how muſt it not needes be a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie to their ſeruants (who are naturally, &amp; for the moſt part more negligent and careleſſe in Gods ſeruice, by reaſon of their corruption, then they can be in the ſeruice of men) to bee depriued of that benefit of their gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours (which is the chiefeſt, and for which cauſe eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially they are committed to their gouernment) name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to be furthered by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the ſeruice of God? but vſe them more like beaſts then men, euen that they might be ſeruiceable vnto them, and then care not whether they ſerue God or the diuell. We know that ſeruants looke to be preferred by their maſters (and ſo there is good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:13563:138"/> when they haue ſerued them faithfully) but what kinde of rewarde is this, that when they haue beſtowed ſome earthly benefit vpon them (by hauing no care to make them ſerue the Lord and ſanctifie his Sabbaths) doe in the ende not onely make them loſe the euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting reward, but preſerue them to eternall deſtruction?</p>
            <p>Moreouer, there are a companie of idle ſeruing men, who being brought vp idly all the ſixe dayes, and in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hauing nothing at all to doe, and are neuer almoſt loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked after vpon the ſeuenth day, are as idle,<note place="margin">Eſpecially in great houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds, where there are many ſeruants.</note> and as little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, as vpon the other: and as they neuer almoſt doe any good dayes worke to their maſters, (for they haue nothing to doe) ſo much leſſe doe they ſpend any Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath in the Lords ſeruice, but they eſpecially are left to goe and come at their will. Others that haue any office of great charge and attendance (as the Cookes and But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, &amp; ſuch like in great houſes) ſeldome or neuer come to the Church, and that but by peeces, either when halfe is done, or els they are readie to depart before halfe bee ended, and ſo both hinder the Lord from that ſeruice, which he ſhould haue by them, and them from that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing which they ſhould inherit this way, and both cauſe the name of God to be ill ſpoken of, and pul vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and them that curſe which belongeth to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual polluting of the Sabbath. And how can they looke that that ſeruice, and that meate and drinke ſhould doe them good, which is thus prepared, and bought (as it were) with the continuall daunger of the ſoules of their ſeruants, beſides the diſhonour of the name of God?</p>
            <p>When <hi>Dauid</hi> had inconſideratly <hi>deſired to drinke of the water of Bethleem, three mightie men brake into the hoste of the Philistines and drew water, and brought it to him, but he would not drinke thereof, but powred it for an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring to the Lord, and ſayd:</hi>

               <hi>O Lord be it farre from me that I ſhould doe thus: is not this the bloud of the men that went in ieopardie of their liues?</hi> How much leſſe then ought
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:13563:139"/> men to eate and drinke that, for which their ſeruants doe venture the liues of their ſoules? And beſides, if we doe iuſtly finde fault with them, who doe neuer or ſeldome preach to the people committed to their charge, and ſo cauſe their ſoules to ſtarue and dye eternally: how can they be blameles, who ſeldome or neuer bring their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to the preaching of the word? And muſt they not needes be culpable of the ſame iudgement before God, ſeeing it is all one with the ſeruants, whether they liue in the places where the word of God is not preached at al, or if it be, yet they come not vnto it?</p>

Nay, I am ſure that the Lord hath layd no ſuch calling vpon any man, that ſhould keepe him in a continuall breach of the Sabbath: and therefore both maſter and ſeruant may ſuſpect that he is in ſuch a calling, as is not agreeable to Gods word, or that he vſeth it not aright, when it maketh him, if not wholly, yet for the moſt part, to neglect the ſeruice of God vpon the Sabbath day. And I know (where there is a great care to ſerue &amp; pleaſe God by prayer) the Lord will giue to them ſuch wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that they ſhalbe able to redeeme if not the whole, yet at leaſt a great parte of the daye; which otherwiſe will be miſpent, namely, by letting paſſe many needleſſe things, preparing ſo much before as conueniently may be, riſing ſo much the more early in the morning, and by the interchangeable helpe of other ſeruants: eſpeciallie when they will for theſe cauſes bee contented with ſo much the leſſe, though not in quantitie (for the reliefe of others) yet leſſe exquiſite and curious dreſſing, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially taketh vp the time: and ſo I am ſure, and they
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:13563:139"/> that will trie it in the feare of God, and in a care to ſerue him, and in a loue to the ſoules of their brethren, ſhall find it to be true by experience, that many might keepe holy the Sabbath, which do not now at all: others might keepe it more then they doe. Which if yet it be thought vnpoſſible, (becauſe we goe not about to practiſe it) let vs but obſerue that which we ſhall ſee done in the houſe, when the ſeruant is very deſirous to goe to a faire, and the maiſter is as willing to let him goe, you would won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſee how things ſhall be diſpatcht vp ſodainely, and in good order, they ſhall be abſent many houres, and yet not greatly miſſed, if any thing be otherwiſe then is vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, it is borne with, becauſe it is a day of making prouiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os for themſelues, and that day is not euery day. So then if the maiſters were perſwaded of the Lords day, as they ought to be, euen that it is the time of making prouiſion for the ſoule, and were as carefull for the ſoules of their ſeruants, as they are for their bodies, and did eſteeme it more for their worſhip and credite, that their ſeruantes were religious, then that they were coſtly and well ſet out in apparell, they would be better contented to ſpare them during the time of that market, where they may buy without money all the graces of Gods ſpirite, and the riches of the kingdome of heauen: whereby they ſhould not onely ſaue their owne ſoules, but bee made more fit to doe dueties to their maiſters of conſcience.<note place="margin">The gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies ſhould take order that they and their whole houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold might come to church toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note>

By which practiſe of theirs, as the doings of many are condemned, ſo it appeareth that the men of our time are led by another ſpirite then they were, and are otherwiſe perſwaded of the worſhip and place they goe vnto: For all the people, nay the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall houſholds come not together, but ſcattered, and one dropping after another in a confuſed manner: Firſt comes the man, then a quarter of an houre after his wife, and after her, I cannot tell how long, eſpecially the maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruants, who muſt needes bee as long after her, as the menſeruants are after him: Wherby it commeth to paſſe that either halfe the ſeruice of God is done before all be met, or elſe if the miniſter tarrie till there be a ſufficient congregation, the firſt commers may bee wearie, and ſometimes cold with tarrying, before the other ſhall bee warme in their ſeates.</p>
            <p>Nowe if it bee demaunded of the maiſters, why they alone make ſuch haſt, and leaue all the reſt behind them, and they anſwer, truely becauſe the time is come wherin vſually publike prayer beginneth: can they bee perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that it is time for themſelues to come (as it is indeed) and yet no time for the reſt to come with him? Hath he no longer time to tarrie, and haue they time to tarry ſo long after him? as though there were one lawe for him,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:13563:140"/> and another for them: or rather that the ſame law of the Sabbath, which mooueth him of conſcience to doe that which he doth, did not as forcibly bind them all as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, nay did not binde him to looke to them, that they ſhould keepe holy the day as well as himſelfe: which if he grant to be true, and yet is not able to bring it to paſſe (where the Lord hath giuen him ſo great authoritie for his owne ſake) partly through the frowardnes of his wife, and partly through the of obſtinacy of the reſt in the familie, his caſe is to be pitied, and he is rather to bee gouerned, then to gouerne,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.4.</note> and he might doe well <hi>to ſet vp one of them in his ſteed,</hi> ſeeing hee doth ſuffer himſelfe wilfully ſo be abuſed, and is contented to be ouer ruled by them in the chiefeſt thing.</p>
            <p>Therefore that he might bring this matter happily to paſſe, as he muſt goe before them by his owne example, and be ready betimes, euen firſt of all, ſo he muſt earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call vpon them for this duetie, and exhort them vnto it, and the ſlower that they are, and the more they drawe backe, the more forward muſt he be, and by his practiſe and words draw them forwards alſo.

Euen as the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> alſo foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, that this ſhall bee the zeale of Gods people in the time of the Goſpell, that they ſhall goe together to ſerue God, and therefore call vpon one another for the ſame purpoſe, ſaying, <hi>It ſhall be in the laſt daies,</hi>

For the man he going firſt out of the doores, ſayth to his wife, make haſt, and come as ſoone as you can: ſhee comming at her leaſure giues the ſame charge to her ſeruants, diſpatch, and tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry not long behind; but here is no ſaying, <hi>Come let vs go, let vs goe together,</hi> and if it be once ſayd it is not purſued, that it might be performed.

So no doubt the diſperſed and broken comming of houſholds to the Church, is a thing greatly obſerued of the Lorde God, and of his Angels <hi>which are preſent at their aſſemblies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.10.</note> and it is that which grieueth the reſt of the Church, and as ſoone as they ſee one come in alone, they are ready with griefe, to aske where are the reſt? what meaneth this partie to come alone?</p>
            <p>Therefore let all gouernours bee perſwaded that it is their bounden duetie thus to looke to their families, and to be ſure that they ſanctifie the day as well as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, and therefore that they not onely thus bring them to the publike miniſterie, but alſo looke vnto them, that they ſpend the reſt of the day in all holy exerciſes, ſo much as may be: examining them in that which they haue heard, and cauſing them to conferre about it themſelues, and to appoint ſome to reade the ſcripture vnto them, and al of them to ſing Pſalmes, and generally whatſoeuer you haue ſeene before, you ought to doe your ſelues, to call vpon them for the ſame, and to take ſuch order, that you be ſure they doe it. And let them be ſorie that they haue
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:13563:141"/> neglected this dutie ſo long heretofore, and therby haue charged ſo many ſinnes of their houſhould vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: and nowe at the laſt in Gods holy feare let them begin to put this in practiſe, leaſt they doe further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke the moſt patient Lord to their endleſſe deſtruction. And though it be a thing ſo rare in the world as it is, and men altogether ſo vnacquainted with it as they bee, nay ſo lothſome and tedious to fleſh and bloud, that they are affraide once to begin with it: yet let the bare comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God preuaile more with vs to take in hande, and to continue in it, then that all that can bee ſaide or thought againſt it, ſhould way with vs, either to keepe vs from it at the firſt, or afterwardes cauſe vs to giue it ouer.</p>
            <p>And that all men might doe it ſo much the rather,<note place="margin">The want of this care in houſholds is the cauſe of much wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, rebellion, and diſorder in their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</note> let them bee aſſured that the want of this eſpecially is the cauſe of ſo many wicked and rebellious children, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtie and diſobedient ſeruants, nay vnfaithfull and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind wiues euery where, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for that their husbands, their fathers, and their maiſters do not call vpon them to ſerue God, and ſee them ſanctifie the Sabbath.

And looke how ſtraightly euery houſeholder is bound to keepe all his familie in the obedience of this Commandement, ſo ſeuerely will it be required at their hands, if al their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and ſubiects throughout the whole land, or any of them doe faile in it, through any default of theirs. And the Lord will require it of them ſo much the more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely, by how much they haue more power to bring e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing to paſſe within their dominion, then a priuat man hath in his houſehold, and the offence that is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like is greater, then that which is priuat. And that this is their very duetie indeede, appeareth firſt by the words of the Commaundement, where he ſpeaketh generally of them that <hi>be within the gates,</hi> namely, either of the houſe or of the citie, which becauſe it is the furtheſt part of thoſe places, therefore by them (as vnder one kinde) hee comprehendeth all the parts of any their iuriſdiction, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

For if to abſtaine from worke be a thing of ſuch moment before the Lord vpon his Sabbath and day of reſt, that he will haue go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours reſtraine their ſubiects from it, then to ſanctifie his holie day, and to beſtowe it vpon his ſeruice, muſt needes much more bee a thing of that importance with him, that he would haue all rulers compell their ſubiects vnto it. Therfore looke how many reaſons and examples haue been before alleadged, to proue that they ought to ſtay men from working vpon that day, ſo many are there to induce them, to inioyne all to keepe holie the day, for which end eſpecially they command the reſt, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, it is meerely ciuill and not religious.</p>
            <p>And for this cauſe did the Lord command his people Iſrael,<note place="margin">

            <p>But the aboue named examples are ſo much the more diligently of vs to bee conſidered; becauſe in them wee haue not only lawes made for the ſanctifying of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, but the execution of them, for that which was done then, was done by law: and though it be a great mercie
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:13563:145"/> mercy of God, to liue where good lawes bee, yet it is greater, where they bee well practiſed: in ſo much that though there be neuer ſo many good lawes made for the inlarging of the Goſpell in any kingdome, it is to no great purpoſe, except they be well looked vnto. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as wee haue ſeene that true religion by law ought to be eſtabliſhed, ſo that it might by all men bee publikely obſerued, all magiſtrates muſt haue an eſpeciall care of that. Of the want of which I am perſwaded there is more cauſe to complaine, then of the former: For though there bee many things wanting to the perfection of the Church, becauſe of our ſinnes, yet all things are not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed which the law requireth for the helping of it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thither, neither are all things done which might be by lawe, for the true ſanctifiyng of the Sabbath euerie where: whether we reſpect thoſe things that might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a learned miniſterie in time, or compell them to preach oftener that can doe it, or make the people come to it more diligently, and profite by it more effectuallie then they doe, which whiles it be more carefully labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after, what hope can there be that they ſhould be any more committed vnto vs, when we are ſo vnfaithfull in this that we haue? For as they prepoſterouſly labour to reforme the Church, that haue no care to reforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and vndiſcreetly complaining of ſome diſorders there, doe not practiſe better orders in their houſes vpon themſelues and theirs, do hinder it and keep them backe: ſo they that labour for more meanes to ſanctifie the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and are careleſſe in practiſing thoſe that they haue, doe ſtay ſuch good bleſſings as God might otherwiſe beſtow vpon his Church this way.</p>
            <p>Therefore we may conclude that all gouernors in the common wealth muſt in their ſeuerall places endeuour by all meanes that GOD hath giuen them,<note place="margin">The great good that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doundes to the common wealth therby.</note> that all the ſubiects of the land doe ordinarily ſanctifie the Sabbath as well as themſelues: and that it be not vnhallowed of

For proofe of which if wee will but take a ſhort view of all the treacheries and treaſons intended againſt her maieſties moſt royall perſon, ſince the beginning of her moſt happy raigne, (whom God of his goodnes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue vnto the full courſe of nature, or rather beyond it) we ſhall finde that they haue beene in thoſe, who were either of a falſe religion (and therefore being enemies to God, muſt needs be enemies to his annoynted) or elſe of no religion at all, &amp; ſo made no difference of perſons, but onely ſought themſelues.

            <p>And it muſt needs be ſo: for beſides that all dueties to our ſuperiours done of conſcience, ſpring of this, that we are perſuaded by Gods word, that they are ſet ouer vs by God in his roome, and therefore for his ſake and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to him, wee <hi>doe giue tribute, to whome tribute belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth; cuſtome, to whom cuſtome; feare, to whom feare;</hi>
